      "heading": "Bringing forward of consecutive disqualification periods to avoid orphan periods",
      "content": "(1)  This section applies to a licence disqualification (an orphan licence disqualification) imposed on a person if—\n(a)  the licence disqualification is to be completed consecutively with another licence disqualification (the primary licence disqualification) for the person, and\n(b)  the primary licence disqualification ends prematurely because it is annulled, quashed or set aside, or is varied to shorten its period, before the date for its completion (whether or not the disqualification has already commenced), and\n(c)  the premature ending of the primary licence disqualification results in a period (the disqualification orphan period) during which the person would, but for this section, not be disqualified from holding a driver licence before the consecutive licence disqualification commences.\n(2)  An orphan licence disqualification is taken by operation of this section (and without the need for a further order of a court)—\n(a)  to commence at the beginning of what would otherwise have been the disqualification orphan period, and\n(b)  to be completed after the expiry of a period that is equivalent in length to the period that the licence disqualification would have been in force if it had commenced and ended as intended.\nNote.\nSection 54(2) provides that the driver of a motor vehicle who drives the vehicle during a period of licence disqualification the commencement and completion dates of which have been altered by operation of this section is not guilty of driving while disqualified unless Transport for NSW has previously given written notice of the altered dates to the driver. However, the operation of this section in other contexts (such as when a person seeks to apply for a driver licence) is not affected.\n(3)  If the operation of this section in bringing forward the commencement of an orphan licence disqualification would result in—\n(a)  any other licence disqualifications intended to be completed consecutively with any different licence disqualifications (whether or not the orphan licence disqualification) not having effect consecutively, or\n(b)  any other licence disqualifications intended to be wholly or partly completed concurrently with any different licence disqualifications (whether or not the orphan licence disqualification) not having effect concurrently,\nthe commencement and completion dates for each of those other licence disqualifications are also brought forward by operation of this section (and without the need for a further order of a court) to the extent necessary to ensure that they continue to have effect consecutively or concurrently, as the case may be.\n(4)  If the primary licence disqualification is reinstated by a court (whether on appeal or otherwise) after this section operates to bring forward the commencement of the orphan licence disqualification, the balance of the reinstated primary licence disqualification remaining to be completed is, unless the court orders otherwise, to be completed—\n(a)  if only the commencement of the orphan licence disqualification is brought forward by operation of this section—immediately after the completion of that disqualification, or\n(b)  if the commencement of more than one consecutive licence disqualification is brought forward by operation of this section—immediately after the last of the consecutive licence disqualifications is completed.\n(5)  For the purposes of this section, a licence disqualification is consecutive with another licence disqualification if it is to commence—\n(a)  when the other licence disqualification is completed, or\n(b)  on a date that coincides with the anticipated date for the completion of the other licence disqualification.\n(6)  Nothing in this section limits any power that a court has—\n(a)  to make an order for licence disqualification (whether or not to be completed concurrently or consecutively with any other licence disqualification), or\n(b)  to annul, quash, set aside or vary a licence disqualification.\n(7)  This section has effect despite anything to the contrary in—\n(a)  the road transport legislation or any other Act or statutory rule, and\n(b)  any order of a court that imposes a licence disqualification (or a period for a licence disqualification) to which this section applies.\n(8)  In this section—\nlicence disqualification means the disqualification of a person under the road transport legislation from holding a driver licence as a consequence of the person being convicted of an offence by a court (whether or not the disqualification is imposed by an order of a court). (1)  This section applies to a licence disqualification (an orphan licence disqualification) imposed on a person if—\n(a)  the licence disqualification is to be completed consecutively with another licence disqualification (the primary licence disqualification) for the person, and\n(b)  the primary licence disqualification ends prematurely because it is annulled, quashed or set aside, or is varied to shorten its period, before the date for its completion (whether or not the disqualification has already commenced), and\n(c)  the premature ending of the primary licence disqualification results in a period (the disqualification orphan period) during which the person would, but for this section, not be disqualified from holding a driver licence before the consecutive licence disqualification commences. (a)  the licence disqualification is to be completed consecutively with another licence disqualification (the primary licence disqualification) for the person, and (b)  the primary licence disqualification ends prematurely because it is annulled, quashed or set aside, or is varied to shorten its period, before the date for its completion (whether or not the disqualification has already commenced), and (c)  the premature ending of the primary licence disqualification results in a period (the disqualification orphan period) during which the person would, but for this section, not be disqualified from holding a driver licence before the consecutive licence disqualification commences. (2)  An orphan licence disqualification is taken by operation of this section (and without the need for a further order of a court)—\n(a)  to commence at the beginning of what would otherwise have been the disqualification orphan period, and\n(b)  to be completed after the expiry of a period that is equivalent in length to the period that the licence disqualification would have been in force if it had commenced and ended as intended.\nNote.\nSection 54(2) provides that the driver of a motor vehicle who drives the vehicle during a period of licence disqualification the commencement and completion dates of which have been altered by operation of this section is not guilty of driving while disqualified unless Transport for NSW has previously given written notice of the altered dates to the driver.

(a)  the road transport legislation or any other Act or statutory rule, and (b)  any order of a court that imposes a licence disqualification (or a period for a licence disqualification) to which this section applies.

(1)  This section applies to an offender to whom an interlock exemption order applies who has completed so much of the disqualification period applicable to the offender under section 205 as is equivalent to the minimum disqualification period that would have been required to be imposed on the offender under section 211(1)(a)(i) if the interlock exemption order had not been made. (2)  Transport for NSW may suspend the disqualification period applicable under section 205 to the offender by issuing an interlock driver licence to the offender under this section. (3)  Transport for NSW must not issue an interlock driver licence under this section unless—\n(a)  the offender satisfies Transport for NSW that there has been a change in the circumstances that existed when the interlock exemption order applying to the offender was made that makes the participation of the offender in an interlock program feasible or practicable, and\n(b)  any other requirements for issue of such an interlock driver licence under this Act have been satisfied. (a)  the offender satisfies Transport for NSW that there has been a change in the circumstances that existed when the interlock exemption order applying to the offender was made that makes the participation of the offender in an interlock program feasible or practicable, and (b)  any other requirements for issue of such an interlock driver licence under this Act have been satisfied. (4)  The issue of an interlock driver licence under this section operates to suspend the disqualification of the offender and convert so much of the disqualification period applicable under section 205 as has not been completed (the incomplete disqualification period) into a converted interlock period. (5)  The converted interlock period is the period—\n(a)  commencing on the day the interlock driver licence is issued, and\n(b)  ending on the later of the day on which—\n(i)  the disqualification period (or periods in total) equivalent to the incomplete disqualification period ends, or\n(ii)  the minimum interlock period (or periods in total) would have ended if a mandatory interlock order had been made against the offender.

(i)  the disqualification period (or periods in total) equivalent to the incomplete disqualification period ends, or (ii)  the minimum interlock period (or periods in total) would have ended if a mandatory interlock order had been made against the offender. (5A)  The minimum interlock period referred to in subsection (5)(b)(ii) commences on the day on which the interlock driver licence is issued and excludes any period of disqualification that would have applied to the offender under section 211(1)(a) had the mandatory interlock order been made. (6)  The suspension under subsection (4) ceases to have effect before the end of the converted interlock period if the offender ceases to participate in an interlock program.\nNote.\nSection 215(2) provides for cessation of participation in an interlock program. (7)  If such a suspension ceases to have effect, the offender is disqualified from holding a driver licence (other than an interlock driver licence or a learner licence) until the day on which a period of 5 years commencing on the day the offender was convicted of the relevant mandatory interlock offence ends."
